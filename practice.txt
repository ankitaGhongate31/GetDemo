Static keyword
1.
when the varible method block declare static keyword that time thes members access two way

1) using class refrance
2) using object


Example

1) A.m1();

A  a= new A();
a.m1();




2.when the call instace method varible that time we neet to compalsary to create object

example
A a=new A();






constructr

use of constructor: constructr it is use to initialize instance varible or non static varible of the class

rule: constrctor name same as class name

    :constructor no have any return type


 type of constructor

1 .parametrized (contructor have parameter is know as parametrrized)
2.non parmetrized((contructor  dont have parameter is know as non parametrrized)


 if java class have no constructo jvm  call default  constructor



This keyword
 this keyword is use to same class another constructor same class another methos same class globle varible


Super keyword
 Super keyword is use to parent class  constructor parent class  methos parent class  varible





opps concept

Inheritance

is relationship 
has relationship

is relationship

1) single level
2) multi level
3) multiple (not support)
4) hirericle
5) hybrid( not support)


 the Parent and child class relationship is called inheritance

 we can achive inheritace  using extend keyword

 parent is super class child is sub class 

 to use inheritance resublity of code




Polimorpisam
 
it mean one name many from
resubility simple code understand easy


1.complieTime
2. run time 

 1.complieTime Polimorpisam

method name same  but different parameter this calles as complie time  Polimorpisam  best example  method voreloding


2. run time Polimorpisam

child class is not satified parent class method implention thet time child class write own implention this call method overloding the example of  run time Polimorpisam is method ovrrriding


Method Voerloding Best Example


Println()  of PrintStream class

Method Voerriding Best Example

Equals() method String class




Encapsulation


warping and groupin data member and method is called encapsulation
we can achive by making data member is private private is use to  data hiding
 
why to use data member private
because  outside person should not acess  internal data directly so we declaring data member is private



Abstraction

Abstraction is a process of handling implemetion detail showing only fucality to user we can use and apply functionality

with their ensstional knowledge only
we can achive abstraction by using Interface and abstract class

Example ATM  Machine,AC


Abstract Class

Abstract class means partioal implemting class
no one can create object of abstract class

if any method is abstract that time we need to class abstract
abstract class have constractr if abstract class no have constractor that time jvm will put default constructor
 
abstract method ended with semi coloum 
ex.public abstract void m1();





Interface

interface is a buch of rules and guidlined
interface rafer for special type of class 
interface can not create object
declaration method allow inside 
interface all varible public final static
interface declare using interface keyword
interface no constructor


interface all method abstract and ened with semicloum

using these intetface we can achive multiple inheritance


class class=extends
interface class= implements
interface intreface=etends


A abstract class
B abstract class extends A

c  java class extends B
main class
 B b =new B();
